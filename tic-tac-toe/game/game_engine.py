"""
GameEngine: owns the board, turn state, and round-end logic.

You (the player) always play X and click to move. The computer always
plays O and moves automatically right after you, using a simple
random-move AI (see game/ai.py) - this is given infrastructure, not
something you need to build.

Starter version: no scoreboard yet, no first-player choice, and only
one combined reset control. Win/draw detection has known bugs (see
game/rules.py and check_round_end below) that Task 1 asks you to fix,
and move validation has a known gap (see handle_click) that Task 3
asks you to fix.
